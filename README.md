# Proyecto-Num-II
This project contains a theoretical work modelling blurry images using Partial Differential Equations and the Finite Element Method (FEM) 
using the diffusion equation with Dirichlet conditions.

-The file 'proyecto_numerico2.pdf' contains the entire report with detailed theorems and demonstrations.

-The file 'poster_numerico_II.pdf' contains a graphical summary of the accomplishments pesented in a poster format.

-The file 'proyecto.m' contains a little example of the implemetation of the code for an image. 
However, it can be used in a bigger and rasonable size images.
